What is VSDSQUADRON FPGA MINI Board?

* The VSDSQUADRON FPGA MINI is a compact and cost-effective FPGA development board designed for learning and prototyping digital design concepts. 
  
* It is an ideal platform for students and engineers who want to explore FPGA programming, hardware description languages (HDLs), and digital system design.

Key Features of the VSDSQUADRON FPGA MINI Board 

* FPGA chip - Lattice iCE40 series FPGA

   + The Lattice iCE40 series is a family of low-power, small-footprint FPGAs designed for embedded applications. It is known for its energy efficiency, fast startup time, and compatibility with open-source tools.
   + Logic Elements (LEs): Ranges from 384 to 7680 logic elements, depending on the model.
   + SRAM-based FPGA: Uses volatile SRAM for configuration, requiring an external configuration memory.
   + Power Efficient: Operates at low power, making it suitable for battery-powered devices.

* Built-in Oscillator
   
   + An FPGA usually requires an external crystal oscillator to generate clock signals. However, the VSDSQUADRON FPGA MINI comes with an internal oscillator.
   + This feature is very useful as it- Eliminates the need for additional components, Provides a stable clock signal for timing operations, and Enables real-time frequency generation and PWM control for applications like LED dimming and motor control.

* RGB LED

   + The board contains a set of multi-color RGB LED, which allows users to test digital logic by displaying different colors.
   + Red, Green, and Blue LEDs are controlled separately via Verilog.
   + Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) can be used to control brightness and create color variations.
